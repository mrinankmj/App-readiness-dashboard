Self-Assessment: Year-End Review (Mrinank Mahajan)
Greetings
I hope you’re doing well. As we approach the year-end review cycle, I wanted to take this opportunity to reflect on my journey so far, the efforts I’ve put in, my key learnings, and the approach I plan to take moving forward.
1) My Efforts
My journey with the organization began with a four-week training program designed to build a strong foundation in both technical and soft skills. During this phase, I developed a deeper understanding of organizational culture and essential concepts in Python, Power BI, and Cyber Security fundamentals, which served as a solid base for my role ahead.
After joining the office on 11th August 2025 as a DevOps resource for CDMS, I began translating my learning into practice. Each week brought new challenges and opportunities:
Weeks 1–2: Focused on strengthening my technical base with tools like Jenkins, Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform, Shell scripting, Linux, Ansible, Splunk, and AppDynamics through LinkedIn Learning and other online resources. I also studied internal systems like the Service Hosting Platform (SHP) to understand CDMS deployment architecture.
Week 3–4: Gained exposure to AWS fundamentals and live CR deployment meetings, enhancing my understanding of infrastructure and security (TPAM). I implemented my first automation task — integrating an API automation testing pipeline directly within Jenkins, including Cucumber reports for better visibility, which streamlined the testing process for the QA team and guided tester to use it. 
Weeks 5–6: Deep-dived into CDMS environment structures, branching strategies, and worked closely with developers to maintain release consistency. Fixed CAGE scanning failures in pipelines by debugging URL and validation parameters, contributing to improved release quality.
Weeks 7–9: Explored internal Kubernetes deployments for Loqate on IKP, built deployment manifests, and worked on Automation Utilities Dashboards for the DATAC team. I also created a UI for an App Readiness Dashboard, which was showcased during the MD visit, earning positive feedback from the leadership team.
Weeks 10–13: Continued collaboration on Loqate deployments, initiated design and development of Apix Meta File Generator (React + Backend), and deployed dashboards using HDPV2 pipelines for cross-platform integrations.
This period taught me not only technical problem-solving but also cross-team collaboration, proactive communication, and adapting quickly to dynamic requirements.
2) My Learnings
Throughout this journey, I’ve seen a significant evolution in both my technical and behavioral competencies.
I developed strong command over CI/CD pipelines, automation, and deployment processes, ensuring timely execution and error-free delivery.
Understood the importance of consistency across environments, documentation, and compliance to organizational best practices — contributing to a more reliable delivery framework.
Improved interpersonal skills through interactions with multiple teams and vendors (Loqate, CDMS Dev team), building better coordination and problem-resolution abilities.
Learned to take ownership — whether it was leading dashboard creation during leadership visits or resolving pipeline issues without dependency.
On the softer side, the culture of “Wednesday Tech Breaks” and peer learning instilled in me a sense of team spirit and belonging that motivates me to contribute more.
While I’m proud of the progress, I also acknowledge a few missed opportunities — for example, I couldn’t participate in the recent hackathon. However, I’m determined to make up for it by actively participating in the upcoming one scheduled for 26th November.
3) Approach to Move Forward
Going ahead, I want to leverage my current learnings to deliver at a higher level of consistency, automation, and innovation. My focus areas for the coming months are:
Deepening my expertise in Cloud-native DevOps tools (AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform) to automate end-to-end deployment cycles.
Enhancing quality and compliance by adhering to best practices, implementing better monitoring, and optimizing pipeline performance.
Contributing toward process improvement by identifying repetitive manual tasks and automating them for efficiency.
Expanding my learning beyond my current project — participating in hackathons, technical forums, and collaborative initiatives to bring fresh ideas to the team.
Continuing my learning path through Secure Code Warrior certifications and internal learning modules to strengthen my application security mindset.
I’m grateful for the mentorship, trust, and opportunities I’ve received so far. This journey has been an incredible blend of learning, challenge, and growth, and I look forward to making even more meaningful contributions to our team’s success in the coming year.
